Abstract
--------

This is an XTerm emulating terminal widget for the awesome
[Blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) Curses environment of
Node.js. It allows the execution of interactive terminal programs in a
Blessed Box-derived widget while providing a full-featured and fully
compatible emulated XTerm rendering environment to those programs.

Blessed XTerm is actually a more modern variant of the Terminal widget
as shipped with the Blessed Curses environment. The difference to the
regular Terminal widget is: (1) the Blessed XTerm widget uses the
newer and more portable [node-pty](https://github.com/Tyriar/node-pty)
module, instead of the ancient [pty.js](https://github.com/chjj/pty.js/)
module, for Pseudo TTY management, (2) it uses the newer and more
sophisticated [XTerm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) module, instead of the
ancient [Term.js](https://github.com/chjj/term.js/) module, for XTerm
emulation, (3) it provides full scrollback buffer support and (4) it
supports starting and stopping multiple commands while the widget is
active.

Installation
------------

```
$ npm install blessed blessed-xterm
```

NOTICE: The `node-pty` dependency module is a Node.js module with
a native C/C++ component. For this a C/C++ compiler environment is
required during `npm install`. For macOS, ensure you have Apple XCode
and its Command-Line Tools installed (you can find them in XCode
under menu `Xcode` / `Preferences` / `Downloads`). For Windows,
you need Microsoft's Visual C/C++ Build Tools installed (you can
conveniently install them with `npm install --global --production
windows-build-tools` from an elevated shell).
